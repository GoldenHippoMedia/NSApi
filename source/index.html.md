# Introduction

Welcome the GHM NetSuite API Guide. This guide will show you the functions created for our internal NetSuite development records.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.
